# POSit-Technologies-Assignment

Steps

1)first created a tree having the properties that sum of child node values are less than the parent node values.

2)Included two .c files -

a) Maintaining the symmetric encryption using the hash value 

b) Creating the tree and checking most of the properties like-

i) If parent node is NULL,it will insert root node(Genesis Node).
ii)Sum of values of child node is always less than the parent node value.
iii)inserting the new node and checking ii) again.

3)Creating a structure of node with all data types 

4)When we integerate both the concepts together using Encryption approach and following tree basic given properties,our queries(test cases) will execute.

5)For longest chain of node we will find the height of tree(in mn.c only)
